Astro is a web framework for building fast, content-driven websites. It allows you to have components/layouts that you can use anywhere on your site without ever thinking or worrying of having mismatched data on your site's pages, with the expense of running a command to make Astro build the site from Astro's syntax to HTML for you.

Unlike static site generators, like 11ty or Jekyll, Astro is a web framework, and can be used to drive both statically-generated sites and dynamically-generated sites (or both), but on this tutorial, I'm going to just focus on it's static site functionality, basically mimicking a feature of a static site generator, but with the features Astro gives, as almost all indie web hosting platforms (e.g. Neocities or Nekoweb) is static only web hosts.

> If you want to look a site that runs Astro, look at [my site's repository](https://github.com/jbcarreon123/gh.jbc.lol/)!

# Prerequisites
You will need:
- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v18.20.8 or v20.3.0, v22.0.0 or higher. ( v19 and v21 are not supported),
- Latest version of `npm`,
- A code editor (I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), and
- a basic knowledge of how a terminal works

Also I recommend installing the official Astro extension, which provides linting and syntax highlighting on Astro files!

# Installation
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
$ npm create astro
```

Now, you will see this:
```bash
$ npm create astro
Need to install the following packages:
create-astro@4.12.0
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

Just press 'y' and wait for it to install, then follow the steps.

For this tutorial, I will use these. You can use anything else, but this should work fine on your config (unless you selected any template other than the 'Use minimal (empty) template').

```bash
 astro   Launch sequence initiated.

   dir   Where should we create your new project?
         .

  tmpl   How would you like to start your new project?
         Use minimal (empty) template

  deps   Install dependencies?
         Yes

   git   Initialize a new git repository?
         No
      ◼  Sounds good! You can always run git init manually.

      ✔  Project initialized!
         ■ Template copied
         ■ Dependencies installed

  next   Liftoff confirmed. Explore your project!
         Run npm run dev to start the dev server. CTRL+C to stop.
         Add frameworks like react or tailwind using astro add.

# Configuration
Before we start, we need to change some settings on the Astro config file, `astro.config.mjs`. That should be in the root of your project folder. Open it and edit it to be like this:
```js title="astro.config.mjs"
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig, passthroughImageService } from 'astro/config';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
    image: {
        service: passthroughImageService()
    }
});
```

That will tell Astro to disable the Sharp image optimization service, which is unsupported for many static web hosts (like Nekoweb or Neocities).

# Creating your 'Hello World' page
Now, open the `index.astro` file on the `src/pages` folder.

After viewing it, you wonder, why it looks like HTML, but with those Markdown frontmatter-like dashes at the top, that's the Astro syntax! It feels like HTML and sounds like HTML but you can do more stuff on it!

But for our hello world page, just edit it like how you would edit an HTML page!

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
---

---

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>Hello world!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        <p>I'm JB!</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

# Running the development server
Now that you have created your hello world page, you wanna know how to show it on your browser locally.

For that, just run `npm run dev`! For the first time running it, it will say that it collects anonymous usage data. If you don't want telemetry, just run `astro telemetry disable`.
```bash
$ npm run dev

> dev
> astro dev

▶ Astro collects anonymous usage data.
  This information helps us improve Astro.
  Run "astro telemetry disable" to opt-out.
  https://astro.build/telemetry

 astro  v5.8.0 ready in 845 ms

┃ Local    http://localhost:4321/
┃ Network  use --host to expose

22:53:10 watching for file changes...
```

Now, on your browser, go to `http://localhost:4321/`, and you should see your hello world page!

# Components and Layouts
Components and Layouts is a powerful part of Astro, which allows you to have reusable code with almost no boilerplate!

Let's create a simple layout that we can use!

1. Firstly, create a `layouts` folder inside the `src` folder.
2. Then, we will create an Astro file. Let's name it `base.astro`.
3. To simplify our lives, let's copy the contents of the `index.astro` file, and let's remove the contents of the `<body></body>` tag.
4. Now, inside `<body></body>`, let's put `<slot></slot>`.

   Your `base.astro` file should look like this:
   ```astro title="src/layouts/base.astro"
   ---

   ---
   
   <html lang="en">
       <head>
           <meta charset="utf-8" />
           <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
           <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
           <title>Hello world!</title>
       </head>
       <body>
           <slot></slot>
       </body>
   </html>
   ```

   Now, you're asking, how do I use it?

5. Now, go back to the `index.astro` file, and remove all code besides the `---` frontmatter and the things inside the `<body></body>` element (so the `<h1></h1>` and `<p></p>` element)
6. Then, inside the frontmatter, put this code:
   ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
   ---
   import Base from '../layouts/base.astro';
   ---
   ```
   That will tell the `index.astro` file to import the `base.astro` file using the `<Base></Base>` tag.
7. Now, let's use it! Wrap the `<h1></h1>` and `<p></p>` element with the `<Base></Base>` tag, like this:
   ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
   ---
   import Base from "../layouts/base.astro";
   ---

   <Base>
       <h1>Hello world!</h1>
       <p>I'm JB!</p>
   </Base>
   ```
8. Save both files, and reload your browser. Now you will see that nothing has changed, but your `index.astro` file now uses the `base.astro` layout!

## Passing properties through components or layouts
Now, you want to pass properties from your index file to the base layout. How do I do it? It's simple, props passing!

Let's pass a title and make the base layout use it, with a default if nothing has set!

1. Go back to your `base.astro` file, and add this to the file's frontmatter:
   ```astro title="src/layouts/base.astro"
   ---
   const { title = "My site title!" } = Astro.props;
   ---
   ```
2. Now, let's use it. We will change the content of the `<title></title>` element from 'Hello World!' to `{title}`!
   ```astro title="src/layouts/base.astro" collapse={1-9, 13-16}
   ---
   const { title = "My site title!" } = Astro.props;
   ---
   
   <html lang="en">
       <head>
           <meta charset="utf-8" />
           <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
           <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
           <title>{title}</title>
       </head>
       <body>
           <slot></slot>
       </body>
   </html>
   ```
3. Now save. You will see that it says 'My site title!'. Now, let's make it change to something by specifying the title on `index.astro`!
   ```astro title="src/pages/index.astro"
   ---
   import Base from "../layouts/base.astro";
   ---

   <Base title="Hello World!">
	   <h1>Hello world!</h1>
	   <p>I'm JB!</p>
   </Base>
   ```
4. Now, after you save it, it should now say 'Hello World!'!

# Styling and CSS
In Astro, you can use either the `<style></style>` tag or you can import the CSS file entirely. Astro will process it automatically and will choose what's best on build time.

Let's make it so our base layout has a style that the pages can use!

First, go back to the `base.astro`, and just put `<style></style>` tags inside the `<head></head>` element, then, let's make the header blue and the background orange, like this:

```astro title="src/layouts/base.astro" collapse={1-10, 22-25}
---
const { title = "My site title!" } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>{title}</title>
        <style>
            body {
                background: orange;
            }

            h1 {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <slot></slot>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now save it. You'll find that only the body selector got affected, and not the heading. That's because Astro uses [Scoped styling](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#scoped-styles) by default, which for a base layout, we want it to be global. To fix that, we can put `is:global` after the `<style>` opening tag like this:

```astro title="src/layouts/base.astro" collapse={1-10, 14-25}
---
const { title = "My site title!" } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>{title}</title>
        <style is:global>
            body {
                background: orange;
            }

            h1 {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <slot></slot>
    </body>
</html>
```

After that, you will see that your styles now work and selects everything!

## External Styles
Now, if you want to have external styles, just create a `styles` folder inside of the `src` folder, then create a normal CSS file inside of it! External styles are global, so you don't need to worry about using `is:global`.

Then, you can import it on the frontmatter, like if you want to create a `base.css` file that is imported on `base.astro`, you can add the code below:
```astro title="src/layouts/base.astro"
---
import '../styles/base.css';
---
```

Now, after saving, it should work and should select everything!

# JavaScript
In Astro, there's two kinds of scripts. Server-side scripts, which resides inside of the `---` frontmatter block and on the `{}` expressions, and client-side scripts, which resides on HTML `<script></script>` elements.

Server-side scripts are ran when your page gets rendered, like if you're developing your side in the dev server, or when building your site. These are useful for things like prop passing, file handling, and many more. If you know how JSX/React works, this might be familiar to you!

For example, this code below looks for blog posts, and shows a list to the user:

```astro title="src/pages/blogs.astro"
---
import Base from "../layouts/base.astro";
const blogs = Object.values(import.meta.glob('./blogs/**/*.md', { eager: true }));
---

<Base title="My Blogs!">
    {blogs.map(blog => 
        <a href={blog.url}>
            {blog.url}
        </a>
    )}
</Base>
```

Client-side scripts, on the other hand, are scripts ran by the browser. This can include things like loading event handlers, loading interactivity, and more! It's like the typical JavaScript syntax you find in HTML code!

## TypeScript
Astro uses TypeScript on it's syntax, whether on the server-side scripts or the client-side scripts. This provides you greater flexibility with defining types, and linting capabilities you won't find in regular JavaScript.

In build time, Astro automatically transpiles TypeScript syntax to JavaScript syntax for you.

If you want to disable TypeScript, you can put `//@ts-nocheck` on the start of the script syntax, or you can disable it project-wide by disabling type checking on your code editor. A simple Google search should suffice.

# Markdown
Astro natively supports Markdown, which is a popular markup language for formatting text. It's useful for making blog posts, tutorials, and more!

Now, to create a markdown file, just create a file with the `.md` extension in the `src/pages` folder! Let's create one called `cool.md`!

```markdown title="src/pages/cool.md"
# Astro is cool!
Markdown is supported!!!
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:4321/cool`, and you will see your Markdown file being translated to HTML, without any external libraries!

## Frontmatter
You can also put frontmatter inside of your Markdown files like this:
```markdown title="src/pages/cool.md"
---
title: Astro is really cool!
---

# Astro is cool!
Markdown is supported!!!
```

Now, we can't access it yet, but we can use layouts to access the frontmatter!

## Markdown Layouts
Like Astro files can have it's layouts, Markdown files can also have it's own layouts. But, unlike Astro files, you can also get the Frontmatter information in Markdown layouts. Let's make one and use it for our `cool.md` file! Let's name it `markdown_base.astro`!

You can copy the existing code on the `base.astro` or we can also make it so `cool.md` references `markdown_base.astro` then we reference the markdown layout to use the `base.astro` file, so if you want to edit the layout, you can just edit the `base.astro` file and it will reflect to the markdown layout! We will use the latter here.

Firstly, create a `markdown_base.astro` file inside the `layouts` folder. Then to simplify our lives, we can copy the code on the `index.astro` as we will use the base layout, but we will replace the thing inside of the `<Base></Base>` layout to `<slot></slot>`. It should look like this:

```astro title="src/layouts/markdown_base.astro"
---
import Base from "../layouts/base.astro";
---

<Base title="Hello World!">
	<slot></slot>
</Base>
```

Now, save it. We go back to the `cool.md` file and let's put a `layout` value on the frontmatter with the Markdown base layout, like this:
```markdown title="src/pages/cool.md"
---
layout: '../layouts/markdown_base.astro'
title: Astro is really cool!
---

# Astro is cool!
Markdown is supported!!!
```

Now, after we save the markdown file, and load it on our browser, we see that the styles we made on the Base layout is now there!

## Passing Frontmatter to Markdown Layouts
You will see that it says 'Hello World!' on the title, and it doesn't say the title we specify on the markdown frontmatter, that's because we need to tell it to use the title element!

Now, on your Markdown layout file (which is `markdown_base.astro`), put this code:
```astro title="src/layouts/markdown_base.astro"
---
import Base from "../layouts/base.astro";
const { title = "My Markdown Page!" } = Astro.props.frontmatter;
---
```

Now, we will define it on the base title property, which will look like this:
```astro title="src/layouts/markdown_base.astro"
---
import Base from "../layouts/base.astro";
const { title = "My Markdown Page!" } = Astro.props.frontmatter;
---

<Base title={title}>
	<slot></slot>
</Base>
```

Now, save it. It should now say the thing you specify on the title frontmatter, with a default 'My Markdown Page!' if there's no specified title!

# Building your site
Now, if you wanna export your site, just run `npm run build`! It should build your site inside the `dist` folder on the root of your project folder!

> Do not edit the built files, as it will going to be overwritten when you run `npm run build` again!

# Reading further
Astro is a very extensive platform, and you can do almost everything on it, so I recommend going to the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) for more stuff like [using frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content), [using layouts on Markdown files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#frontmatter-layout-property), [using components from other frameworks like Svelte or React on your Astro application](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/), [Dynamically rendering files](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/routing/#static-ssg-mode), and more!

You can also search the [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/) page for things you can add into Astro!

That's about it, and if you want something to be added it, let me know in the comments!!!
