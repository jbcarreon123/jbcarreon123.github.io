And thanks for Dean for letting us ask some questions!

## First off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
Hey, I'm dean. I'm a programmer, I like to develop stuff, browse personal websites, forums and such. I enjoy reading stuff related to history and archiving. Other things I enjoy doing are reading books, and listening to cool music.

## What made you want to create a website in the first place? What is the main goal of their website: is it art? personal? for writing? to connect with others?
When I stumbled upon Nekoweb on dimden's site, I was looking for a project that I could host on Nekoweb, that has a purpose. A wiki came to mind.,

The main reason the Nekoweb Wiki exists is to inform and help people, and archive things related to Nekoweb.

## Do you have an audience in mind when making your website? What audience is it aimed towards?
The audience the wiki targets are essentially all Nekoweb users.

## What have been some experiences you've had creating a website?
I've made some sites, some are personal, some are projects, sometimes I just design a site because I have a really nice design in mind. Most of them never make it to the internet.,

I mostly self taught myself HTML/CSS, although I have not learned HTML/CSS fully. I have started on JS, but have not finished it and know a bit of it. This is mostly because of my ADHD. I jump from one project to another, and my attention span is not long because of it.

## What are some challenges you've had to deal with?
I haven't really got a challenge from the wiki, yet. Not counting the occasional markdown errors (mostly my fault), though.

## What tools do you use to make your site? What languages and/or frameworks do you utilize?
I used to update the wiki by hand from the nekoweb web editor.,

Now, the wiki has its own custom SSG! Made by Steve0Greatness, who is one of the members of the wiki. It is written in python. We use github and the tool nekoweb-deploy to automatically push the updates/changes made by the SSG.

## How do you come up with the design of your website? How does it go from its first conception -> its finished product?
I first draw a sketch on paper (I do this with almost every website I make) with the things I want. Then I start making the site with the layout as I want it, with test colors and text. Then I start adding the functionality (like mobile friendliness) that I want/need for the site. As final I add the text and the correct colors and I polish the layout, and test the entire site out. The wiki has had two layouts by now.

## Are there any people or websites that you really liked or inspired you?
Most kawaii-ish themed websites were the inspiration for the current wiki layout, I don't know anymore which specific sites it were, though..

## Would you recommend other people make websites? If so, why?
Yes! It is very fun to do, you can design your site in any way you want, you can make your site personal or about a certain topic, it is all up to you!

## Are there any stuff you want and/or plan to add but haven't been able to for any reason?
I have been planning on redoing a certain article, but I haven't got to it, because other articles have priority and a bit of laziness. New articles are planned / on the way, so it will probably be a long time before I get to doing that.

## How do you feel about your website now? Do you think you have improved compared to previous versions? Are you happier with it now?
I'm quite happy how it turned out! It has certainly improved from the first layout, The current has a dark theme and mobile friendliness, which the first one lacked.

## What would you like to say to the person reading this now?
Have a nice day, and happy coding!
