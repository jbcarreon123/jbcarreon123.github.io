Visit July's site at [july.lol](https://july.lol/)!

## First off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
Hello I am July, the webmaster for july.lol. I enjoy outer space a lot, I'm a hobbyist photographer, I play a lot of video games (especially VR), and I'm a huge fan of music.

## What made you want to create a website in the first place? What is the main goal of their website: is it art? personal? for writing? to connect with others?
There was a friend of a friend of mine who had a website in their bio and when I visited it, they had Yesterwebring at the bottom and I was like "Wtf is Yesterweb?" Fast-forward a couple days and I felt like I found the missing nostalgic piece of myself that I had been looking for for years. Originally, I wanted my website to be a place to show off everything I've done. Almost like a portfolio of sorts. But now it's sort of a mix between a personal site and what I've made.

## Do you have an audience in mind when making your website? What audience is it aimed towards?
Honestly, I think anyone can come see my site. It's not geared towards specific people so anyone is welcome to check it out.

## What have been some experiences you've had creating a website?
There's been some ups and downs when making my website, for sure. But I'd have to say that learning about good web design has helped me a ton. In my opinion, although being able to create whatever you want is one of the key points of the indie web, I still think your website having good UX is just as important.

## What are some challenges you've had to deal with?
JavaScript.

## What tools do you use to make your site? What languages and/or frameworks do you utilize?
Some people might shun me for doing this but I wrote my entire site in HTML, CSS, and JS into VSCode. Then when I'm done, I copy and paste all the code into the Nekoweb editor and publish. I know there's plenty of easier ways to do it, but I am too lazy to learn those ways. Quite ironic if you think about it.

## How do you come up with the design of your website? How does it go from its first conception -> its finished product?
I'm a big fan of cassette futurism as a style, so I tried to recreate a terminal-like design with the famous black and green colors. But I found that I also really enjoy smooth transitions between pages, so I went with that as well. _**Originally**_, I used to use XP.css or whatever it's called to maybe make my website into those OS-styled sites. But it kept fighting me when clashing two stylesheets together lol.
    
## Are there any people or websites that you really liked or inspired you?
[whiona.me](http://whiona.me) was a big inspiration for a lot of my old designs. Nowadays, I find myself going to [rice.place](https://rice.place/) or [moondvsted.space](https://moondvsted.space/) a lot.
    
## Would you recommend other people make websites? If so, why?
If you've always wanted to make a website for yourself, DO IT. Not only will you learn a cool thing, you'll look cool doing it.
    
## Are there any stuff you want and/or plan to add but haven't been able to for any reason?
I really want to redo my music player at some point. I also have to rearrange a lot of the pages because some of them have stuff in it that doesn't make sense, to me anyway.
    
## How do you feel about your website now? Do you think you have improved compared to previous versions? Are you happier with it now?
I feel like I definitely improved since I started. As for right now, I think it needs some TLC since there's not much going on with it, but I like it still.
    
## What would you like to say to the person reading this now?
Your place on the web is yours and yours alone. You don't need approval from others to put what you want on your site. Do whatever you want!
