And thanks for Aislyn for letting us ask some questions!

## First off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
I'm Aislyn Weaver, creator of Districts - Nekoweb’s most followed project. I also run a loosely defined creative collective called WVR.MOE. We make websites in Microsoft Excel, build bots, host convention panels, run the occasional fundraiser, and do other nonsense. It's dumb. It’s fun. Check us out at WVR.MOE.

## What made you want to create a website in the first place? What is the main goal of their website: is it art? personal? for writing? to connect with others?
Site directories like Nekoweb Districts exist to connect. The web is vast - and real people are often buried under centralized algorithmic media feeds, bot networks, and AI sludge. Districts' aim is to carve out a space where real Nekowebbians can find each other in their very own town square. The reason I first made it is... well, frankly because no one else had. ( ; ^.^)

## Do you have an audience in mind when making your website? What audience is it aimed towards?
Districts is for everyone on Nekoweb. Anyone with a Nekoweb subdomain can list their site. Its strength is in its openness - it’s a community project that doesn’t gatekeep. It is as much yours as it is mine, so I encourage you to join in by listing your site! ( o≧∇≦)o

## What have been some experiences you've had creating a website?
Nekoweb Districts was built in a frantic two day sprint. I’m not a particularly good coder, so everything was done with a “good 'nuff” mindset. But once it went live, the community showed up in force. At the time of writing, it lists over 100 sites! Every time a new listing enters my inbox, I get a little excited.

## What tools do you use to make your site? What languages and/or frameworks do you utilize?
Nekoweb Districts is pure HTML and CSS, built on a static layout generator. Every single listing is hand-coded with love. ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡ Anyone could’ve made it, but that's kind of the beauty of this space. The barrier to entering the indie web community is extremely low. Passion is the only requirement.

## How do you come up with the design of your website? How does it go from its first conception -> its finished product?
Aesthetically, Districts riffs on the old Nekoweb homepage. I borrowed its colour palette in an attempt to ground the site in the Nekoweb community. The banner is styled after one of the few Nekoweb had when it first started out. As for the refinement process... it's pretty messy. Once *I* figure out how it works, I'll let you know. ꉂ(≧▽≦)

## Are there any people or websites that you really liked or inspired you?
Site directories are not a new concept. Both Geocities and Neocities used to have directories that categorized sites based on "districts." I liked the spirit of those spaces... open, community oriented, and full of friends connecting with one another - just like a real city ought to be.

## Would you recommend other people make websites? If so, why?
Absolutely. There’s no excuse not to. Districts isn't popular because of any complex technology running it, or how beautifully coded it is. Absolutely anybody could have made it, and that's the power of the indie web. Anyone can spend a weekend on W3Schools and build a site to connect with. There's no restrictions on colours, or bio character count, or how legible your text is. The web is your canvas. So make something weird. Make something cool. Make something yours.

## What would you like to say to the person reading this now?
If you haven't yet, now is a great time to join Nekoweb Districts! Over 100 people are listing their website on Nekoweb's most followed project, and you can too! Just email your site title, description, URL, and any 88x31 buttons to ACE@WVR.MOE.

Oh, and check out WVR.MOE. (⌐⎚u⎚)
