## First off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself?
hello!! i'm ivy, or.. noelle?, or i'm not sure you can call me whatever really ^\_^" i make little websites and do funky things on the interweb and that's pretty much the gist of what i do :3

## What made you want to create a website in the first place? What is the main goal of their website: is it art? personal? for writing? to connect with others?
I'm not sure! Initially I made it as a place to practice my coding skills but it turned into it's fun little dumpster fire bubble in a special corner of the internet and i think that's really fun!!

## Do you have an audience in mind when making your website? What audience is it aimed towards?
it's mostly made for me i suppose, but also as a nice way to put out cool little first impressions for those who stumble into it, it's a bit more nicer and personal compared to like--linktrees or something yknow? it's very awesome

## What have been some experiences you've had creating a website?
honestly just the fun of learning and discovering more tools covers the experiences i've had with creating one

## What are some challenges you've had to deal with?
i think like, my biggest challenge in creating my current iteration is that "how do i make this design sustainable enough to not warrant a new redesign?", because as of writing this right now; ivrry is the 11th major redesign in my whole website-making journey and i \*really\* don't wanna write a new one slfjdsf

## What tools do you use to make your site? What languages and/or frameworks do you utilize?
for my site, i initially went with a jankily taped-around self-made SSG written in python, but as of recently i decided to rewrite the whole thing in Rust just for the sake of doing it. i think that's really funny bahaha

## How do you come up with the design of your website? How does it go from its first conception -> its finished product?
it started out really simple! i initially took two sites as my inspiration, and started basing it off of those--but overtime, it just grew and evolved into it's own design and i think that's the thing that makes the indieweb so cool and beautiful

## Are there any people or websites that you really liked or inspired you?
bwahaha if i had to list them it would probably be a very long article, but shoutout [nat.envs.sh](http://nat.envs.sh) and [zelo.dev](https://zelo.dev/) for initially inspiring the current iteration of the site

## Would you recommend other people make websites? If so, why?
go make websites!! gogogo!!! just do it as practice or when you're bored because it lets you learn something new and express yourselves in ways current-day social media couldn't!! its really fun and it makes you super duper cool!! go do it!!

## Are there any stuff you want and/or plan to add but haven't been able to for any reason?
probably just like, a bunch of cool server-side exclusive widgets honestly, i just don't have the funds to keep up the server behind it :\_)

## How do you feel about your website now? Do you think you have improved compared to previous versions? Are you happier with it now?
i think i'm really proud of what i've made so far, it's by far one of my best websites design of all time and i'm so glad i could show it to you all ^\_^

## What would you like to say to the person reading this now?
shoutout zelo, natalie, celestial, unnick, sneexy, hydrogencitrus you too if you're reading, slime, finn, and the rest of my cool cool friends, the whole indieweb community, and you too!! for reading this :3
