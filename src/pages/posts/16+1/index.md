Hey there! It's that day of the month again, where my age increments!
There's been a lot that's happened, it's really complicated to discuss it, but oh well.

I don't have much anything to say on this mini-log, but thank you all for the journey
I'm on right now.

# What I'm gonna do right now?
Currently, I'm planning and doing my [nekozine](https://zine.nekoweb.org/) entry, so
stay tuned for that!

Other than that, I am actively working on the long awaited [indieseas](https://indieseas.net/) frontend overhaul! Here's some preview images of it!

Of course, we also support mobile!

Alongside that, I'm also actively working on this site (duh!) and a thing that you don't wanna miss!

That's about it for now, and I plan to make a thing for my 18th birthday, so also stay
tuned for that! Thanks for reading my post and thanks for riding in on my journey!

Also seems like I'm nearing 50 followers and 20k views in Nekoweb. Nice!
