I'm writing this on March 10 on my phone. School is about to end in 2 weeks, and it's pretty exciting to actually do something else than glance with the school works, procrastinate, and get angry on my arch nemesis. Constantly juggling between my groups practical research 1, the final outputs of each subject, my personal projects, and my real life stuff definitely took a toll on my physical and mental health.

Today, I only had a 30 minute sleep because I can't sleep over the issues I'm going to challenge on the day, like what I'm gonna pay for the tools needed for the final output of our ICT class, and the constant reminder of me, my mind just thinking about our PR1 as that is the major project I have on Grade 11, failing that would indur a 50/50 chance of me repeating the grade. But because my mind is just getting more confused when I'm looking at our paper, I can't do it, but I just woke up during midnight constantly refreshing my page because Nekoweb is down.

Just earlier, one of my group mates got angry with me as I'm not responding to our PR1 group chat about the things we will do on weekends. I just want a break during weekends and don't mind the school works so I could relax and just do what I want to do, code jbsite3. But I understand what they did because there's only 2 weeks, and our final research defense is next week.

On vacation, I'm just gonna do my site (though I also might contribute to Poyoweb) and add some things I want to put on it, though deploying would be pretty challenging as I'm going back to QC and we only have a cellular based prepaid WiFi there, but I can do it.
