So uhh, this is now the site that I'm gonna post stuff on!

# What happened on your hosted server???
It's still here with me (and fun fact: the posts page and soon the SBR will be hosted on my VPS as they are dynamic stuff lol), and still hosts the discord bots that I host!
I just want to avoid the thing that already happened to me, which is that my debit card ran out of balance and took down everything (and my server's IP is changed) so yeah...

# What new features does the new site has?
New interface, and idk.
