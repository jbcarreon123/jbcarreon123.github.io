So, AI. A buzzword you might hear at least once. If you're not, you're basically living
under a rock. It's one of the most useless buzzword now companies are using to hype their
basic stuff by slapping "AI" into it. Probably because to tease shareholders. It's so overused nowadays that you can't escape it.

But, I DON'T WANT FUCKING AI INTO MY FUCKING KEYBOARD! It's just there to be used as a input
device, NOT TO RUN A FUCKING LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL!

Let's see some examples of this:

# My new daily driver phone
I switched from a Vivo Y03 to using a Infinix HOT 50i, and let me tell you, this phone
is filled with much AI as possibly can. It also has this AskAI thing in the context menu
WHICH IS JUST GETTING MISCLICKED.

Well this phone is an example of copying someone else stuff (it also has a dynamic island clone
called the 'Dynamic Bar' which I also don't want).

I should probably put a review of this phone and ranting some features on this phone but its fine currently.

# Google AI Summaries
So, how does the biggest ~~monopoly~~ search engine got here? Let's talk about the Google
AI Summaries they got.

It got mocked in it's infancy because it recommended people to eat rocks, put glue on pizza, and more:

# That's about it for now
And me will just idk, cope with these ai or something
