So, Bluetooth. Love it or hate it, there is some quirks regarding Bluetooth devices and stuff.

# Windows' implementation of Bluetooth sucks
Sometimes, my devices just don't connect at all, and even failing to remove the device.  
It sometimes fights me if it wants to connect or not, and if not, Windows just says "iT WoNT ConNEcT!" 

And best of all, almost all the time, one of my school professor's laptops running Windows 11 just fails
to connect to our Bluetooth speaker on our room, and it can't even find it when we do the disconnect reconnect
trick. (in fairness, our speaker is one of those cheap ones that says "tHe bLuEtOoTh dEvIcE Is rEaDy tO PaIr" lol)

Also another thing about Bluetooth in Windows is that I recommend **avoiding using the __[Bluetooth device name] Hands-free [smth]__**
because that would just absolutely squash your audio quality, and even sometimes, it can lead to your laptop to cease working with your headphones.

# Latency, oh latency.
One of my pet peeves about Bluetooth is the latency it has on sound, which making video consumption
difficult and disorientating. It makes video and audio very unsynced and its not great.

# Why does Bluetooth bleaching the sound quality when I'm on a call?
Yes, I know that it's because of Bluetooth limitations but it still baffles me that my ₱600 wired in-ear monitors
beats my friends ₱10000 bluetooth in-ears on call sound quality.

# Anyways, Bluetooth is still okay for me
But I'll stay on my wired earphones. The only thing I use that is only connected to Bluetooth
is my keyboard connected to my TV, because typing using the remote SUCKS.
