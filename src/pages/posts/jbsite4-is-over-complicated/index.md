Hey there! It's been a long time since I posted anything, so here's a mini post about how overly complicated jbsite4 is to develop and do, and how I actually love this instead of hating it.

jbsite4 is my fourth iteration of my site, which I made it more tailored of how do I do UI design and such, which makes this site modern (and actually stand out on the indie web).

It has been my bread and butter for like 3 months now and I'm still improving it day after day, which helps as I'm almost always bored because there's nothing to do at home.

This site also helps me learn more JS, like the [other sites](/other-sites/) page uses Playwright so I can put site previews dynamically, cool isn't it?

School starts in like 2 days and I'm mostly excited that I can now go somewhere aside from store or house.

Probably, that's it, see ya soon when I manage to finish a post...
