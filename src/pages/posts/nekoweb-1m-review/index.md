Hey there! It's been a month since I joined Nekoweb and used it as the host of the new version of my site for a month now, so what do I think of it?

> <p class="text-xs">Update 3/29/2025</p>
>
> A lot has happened on the Discord server on the past 24 hours.
> The rules has been revamped, there are new mods and it's really cool that Dimden actually listened to the community and I am thankful for him.
>
> I'm also thankful for the community that pushed for this to happen, and shout out to Crystal for helping the community make this happen (honestly, thank you, a lot!)
>
> If you haven't already, [join Nekoweb Discord](https://discord.gg/hvfHKyVS6b)! There's some cool folks here (and I am active when I can!)

# So first, how did I find Nekoweb?
This might be the weirdest way possible that someone has found something, but here's how:
On that day, I was watching Theo's (t3.gg) video about nice looking websites, like people who use Three.js and other stuff on their site, and I'm also looking for some inspirations for jbsite3. I don't really have the time back then yet to make something with Three.js and mess with WebGL, so I'm just looking at them in awe.
Then I found out about Dimden's site, it's much simpler than the 3d sites I've seen on that video, and I'm curious about the Sidelink Ads service he has. So I visited his site, looking to put my site on the Sidelink Ads then found that it's closed. After that, just looked around the site, and on the project's list, I found Nekoweb. I do need a new host that time because my server back then is in a brink of shutting down (and 2 days after I registered on Nekoweb, it fully shut down), so I registered on it.

# The service itself
The service is mostly, great. I haven't found some big issues since I started using Nekoweb but found some small quirks (like a bug where it removes the URL params when redirecting from /page to /page/) but mostly the service is great. I rate it maybe 4.5 out of 5 stars.

I will give some suggestions though:

- The theme chooser on the old Nekoweb UI is great, even though I haven't experienced it fully, I prefer dark mode and using userstyles on Stylus isn't the best bet for a couple of reasons (the biggest part is that it is hard to make it consistent on every device) so a theme chooser is a nice to have.
- The site box shouldn't be overflown to the entire page and just give it a maximum size to overflow. I don't really care about this but heard about Cereza overflowing the follow button to the entire page, it's not great to have.
- The API is great, but probably allow users to bump their updated count when they're updated on the API. Though deploy2nekoweb and my Svelte Nekoweb Adapter has workarounds on this, but I don't really like it and giving API users less features isn't great.

But, the most impacting part of Nekoweb is the community and I want to focus on it, so let's get into it.

# The community
The community is one of the largest part of the experience on a service, and Nekoweb is no exception.

Joining the Discord and I'm greeted on entry. It's one of the nice touch a community gives to a person to tell them that you should enjoy using the service. So I got active on the server, like really active. Helped people on their HTML/CSS/JS stuff, created the Svelte Nekoweb Adapter to easily deploy my site (and polished it so people can use it), and chatted with people on the server, and looking about it, I might actually one of the most active people in the discord since I joined.

At the time of writing, the server has 3300 members and counting, and that's a lot actually. The server has experienced its ups and downs while I'm there, people helping each others, constantly chatting something, it's a very lively server, but there's some situations that people got into an argument or something.

In any online platforms I participated on, I'm pretty chill and I don't like being hostile to people. It's not my cup of tea to get hostile on some things because it just sucks.

The most biggest argument I've ever witnessed on the server is the idea of making websites mobile friendly and accessible to anyone. I honestly agree that making your site mobile friendly and accessible is nice because it's the modern age and phones are the biggest contributor of internet traffic. That's my opinion and everybody doesn't agree on it. That's fine, but making it an argument isn't fine.

Another thing on the server is that some people can say offensive and uncomfortable stuff (for me) without any repercussions, which is pretty wild on a server that has 3000 members and counting. This is not great. I'm 16, and the sexual jokes on the discord are pretty mind-boggling to me. It's very uncomfortable to me, let alone other people on the server who either younger than me or OLDER than me. 

Also I feel like the discord has less moderation efforts than expected. The rules is also pretty barebones and for a person that administrated a server that have member counts on par to Nekoweb Discord, it's very much causing the lack of moderation on the server because the rules are very broad that you don't even know what rule it breaks.

## Rule Review

Let's review the rules on the Nekoweb Discord (as a discord server admin perspective):

- don't be bad
- be good
  > Both of these should be consolidated into one, having 2 rules for the same thing is just unnecessary

- don't talk about sexual topics.
  > Self-explanatory but I feel like this rule keeps getting broken without any repercussions

- be kind to others
  > This rule might be merged to the first 2 rules also

- if something doesn't change or load, press CTRL+SHIFT+R or CTRL+F5 to clear browser cache (or use whatever button your browser has to do it). if it still doesn't work/you cant figure it out, try going on your site from different browser/device, and if it still doesnt load/change, ONLY THEN report a bug. ALSO if you use Cloudflare create Bypass cache rule in Page rules and clear cache in Cloudflare
  > Self-explanatory but some people miss this thing and just ask anyways (always remember to pin this to the specific channels alongside it being a rule)

- spend at least a hour trying to learn html/css before asking any questions in ⁠#webdev or ⁠#coding-help.
  some resources: #⁠webdev
  > Yeah! I honestly agree on this rule.

- read https://nekoweb.org/faq before asking questions
  > Some people won't visit a page to just read stuff before asking. Probably the best thing is to have a copy of the FAQ page on a separate channel on the server.

- no political debates
  > Self explanatory

- dont be annoying
  > This rule might also be possible to be merged into the first 2 rules 

- only use English
  > Self explanatory also.

There's some rules that should be merged into one rule, and there's some rule that people might not follow. Also, I would suggest adding rules for following the [Discord Community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) as it aims for a server that's for everyone, and protects the younger members of a server.

# Final thoughts
I honestly enjoy Nekoweb, and enjoys being in the Discord. I have talked to many people on the server that are kind and have enthusiasm, and I wanna be part of the community. I love to chat with people and it's nice to see people making their sites and having a great time, helping others, and providing things to use on the server.

That's about it! If you have things to say, why not comment?
