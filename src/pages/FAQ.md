## Can I use some code from your site?
Sure! It's actually okay for me, especially if you're crediting me.
## Can I use your site's layout?
In certain circumstances, you can, but I wouldn't recommend abruptly copying my site code without knowledge of how it works.
**I honestly recommend you to instead, learn how to code your site, because that will allow you to debug any issues on your site.**
## Can I refer or quote some content on your site?
Sure! Almost all content on my site is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0, so that means the content referring my work should have the same or compatible license.
Though, there's some scenarios that I won't allow to use my content of my site:
- if you're training an large language model
- if you're slapping it into an NFT
- if you're just mocking my content (but criticism is allowed and appreciated)
- or if you're just a jerk
